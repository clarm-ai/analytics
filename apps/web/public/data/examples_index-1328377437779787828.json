I'm now happy to announce the winners:\n\n1Ô∏è‚É£ CoAct_1 ‚Äî <@620592561974935553> \nImplemented a new agent architecture inspired by recent research, rebuilding the core loop in Python. Integrates Cua for computer use with Ollama optional for GUI grounding. Includes a polished frontend and modular design.\n\n2Ô∏è‚É£ Trajectory Redaction with Perceptron ‚Äî <@229137745237245953> \nA clean, practical extension of Cua enabling local trajectory and screenshot redaction. Uses callbacks and a local Perceptron Isaac model for visual redaction, with Ollama as an optional LLM for text redaction.\n\n3Ô∏è‚É£ Sarvaj√±aGPT ‚Äî <@1085162835593674813> \nA local-first AI assistant integrating Cua automation with Ollama (Qwen) for multimodal, privacy-preserving workflows.
