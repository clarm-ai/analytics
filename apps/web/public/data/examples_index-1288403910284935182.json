So what I need from Better Auth is just this implementation of sessions (though Next.js has no database connection, only Express.js has).\n\nThe communication between Express.js and Next.js is done via access/refresh tokens, but the endpoints are not standard OAuth2 endpoints - they are custom coded.\n\nI checked on bearer and jwt plugins and it doesn't seem to be doing what I need, and I need to use Better Auth to communicate with my Express.js from Next.js app.\n\nWhat is the best way to integrate Better Auth inside my Next.js app?"

When I integrate with better-auth with a backend service (say nestjs / express) it automatically sets up all the required api endpoints in the server. I am wondering if there is any documentation regarding the same. From where I am coming, I want to test out some protected endpoints from postman / bruno, and to get the session I will require to call the endpoints setup by better-auth.\n\nCan anyone help me on this? And maybe its better if we can have a section for this in the documentation if we do not have already."

      "text": "OIDC provider: do trustedClients persist to DB, or do I still need to register/seed clients?\n\nI’m using the OIDC provider plugin with jwt() (useJWTPlugin: true). Issuer + discovery are good; JWKS (RS256) is working. I added a trustedClients entry like:\n```ts\ntrustedClients: [\n  {\n    clientId: \"my-public-client\",\n    type: \"public\",\n    redirectURLs: [\"https://example.com/callback\"],\n    skipConsent: true,\n    metadata: { internal: true }\n  }\n]\n```\n\n\nWhen the code flow hits /oauth2/token, my server logs show a DB error inserting into the access-tokens table due to a FOREIGN KEY constraint referencing the client id. My OIDC tables (e.g., oauth_applications / oauth_access_tokens or camelCase variants) were empty, which makes me think the FK expects a client row but trustedClients didn’t create one.\n\nQuestions:\n\nDoes trustedClients automatically create/persist an oauthApplication (client) row, or is it purely in-memory for consent/lookup bypass?\n\nIf it doesn’t persist, what’s the recommended way to create the client record without enabling open dynamic registration in production? (Is there a CLI/SDK helper or a standard migration/seed path?)\n\nIs there support (or a roadmap) for Initial Access Tokens so /oauth2/register can stay protected but still allow admin-initiated dynamic registration?\n\nFor public clients, should the stored metadata include type = \"public\" and token_endpoint_auth_method = \"none\"? Any guidance on exact table/column names (snake vs camel) for manual seeding?\n\nFor context, calling POST /oauth2/register returns {\"error\":\"invalid_token\",\"error_description\":\"Authentication required for client registration\"} when allowDynamicClientRegistration is false, which suggests registration is intentionally locked. I’m trying to confirm the best practice to pre-create clients in the DB for production."

      "text": "Hey, is there a guide to using jwts with better-auth? I've read the docuemntation about bearer plugin and have it enabled and setup. https://www.better-auth.com/docs/plugins/bearer\n\nIt says that After a successful sign-in, you'll receive a session token in the response headers. Store this token securely (e.g., in localStorage):\n```ts\nconst { data } = await authClient.signIn.email({\n    email: \"user@example.com\",\n    password: \"securepassword\"\n}, {\n  onSuccess: (ctx)=>{\n    const authToken = ctx.response.headers.get(\"set-auth-token\") // get the token from the response headers\n    // Store the token securely (e.g., in localStorage)\n    localStorage.setItem(\"bearer_token\", authToken);\n  }\n});\n```\n\nThis works as said for `authClient.signIn.email` and I can see the authToken if i console log it inside the `onSuccess` callback. But this doesnot work for `authClient.signIn.social`.\n\nI am using this\n\n```ts\nasync function socialSignIn(provider: \"google\" | \"apple\") {\n    await authClient.signIn.social(\n      {\n        provider: provider,\n      },\n      {\n        onSuccess: (ctx) => {\n          console.log(\n            \"authtoken in ctx of socialSignIn:\",\n            ctx.response.headers.get(\"set-auth-token\"),\n          );\n          navigate(\"/\");\n        },\n        //...\n      },\n    );\n  }\n\n//...\n```\n\nThe statement \n```ts\nconsole.log(\n            \"authtoken in ctx of socialSignIn:\",\n            ctx.response.headers.get(\"set-auth-token\"),\n          );\n```\n\nruns instantly when `socialSignIn(\"google\")` is called after clicking the signin button and I see the log statement. but this doesn't run after i \"choose an account\" -> \"continue\" and come back to main dashboard. when am i supposed to get the bearer token in social signin?"

      "text": "Hey,  I originally asked this question on <#1296058482289676320> but I'm not sure if that's the right place so I'll just ask it here too. I’m having a little bit of a hard time implementing the OIDC plugin and I’m not sure if it’s a problem on my side. I’ve set up better Auth on my node API with the oidc and email and password plugins. So the idea is that my web app will redirect to the login page hosted on the API and once user has successfully logged in, they will be redirected back to the web app with the Auth code and be able to request for the Auth token. I’ve set up the login page and the redirect from web app to login page works, but after the user logs in (using the auth client), the login page just refreshes with the server_error query parameter. I’ve set the logger to “debug” but don’t see anything in the server logs. Any tips on how else I can debug this?"
